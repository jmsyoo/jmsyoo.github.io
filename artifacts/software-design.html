    <h2>Why This Artifact & What It Showcases</h2>
    <p>
      This backend workflow highlights real design choices: request validation, transactional safety, and stable API contracts.
      I demonstrate separation of concerns (Controller → Service → Serializer), defensive programming (guardrails, format checks),
      and concurrency safety (row-level locking). The goal is production-minded code that’s still easy to maintain and test.

    <h2>How the Artifact Was Improved</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Controller delegates business logic to Services; Serializers fix response shape (contract-first).</li>
      <li>Verification flow adds input guardrails, optional format validation, and a true single-pass aggregation.</li>
      <li>Mark-sold flow wraps state transition in one transaction and uses row-level locks to prevent double-selling.</li>
      <li>Optional idempotency key for safe retries; standardized error envelopes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Course Outcomes & Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      I strengthened design and evaluation of solutions by restructuring for maintainability and performance,
      applied solid software engineering techniques (service layering, contracts, transactional boundaries),
      and improved security posture with validation and locking. Biggest lesson: small architectural changes
      have big downstream benefits; clear boundaries made testing and reasoning easier.
